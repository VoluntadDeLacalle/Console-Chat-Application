<h1>Console Chat App</h1>
<h2>Made by William Lacalle</h2>

<p>Welcome to my Winsock driven Console Chat App made for Windows. To run the application, download the repo and run the solution in Visual Studio. Once the application is running, you will want to open your command prompt, Linux OS, or any console and connect to the server through your localhost with the port of 8888. When testing I personally used Ubuntu for Windows and was successfully able to connect to the server by typing "telnet localhost 8888". As this is a chat app, you will want to run another instance of your console or another instance of a console on a different computer, but ensure that the computer in question is on the same network. This will work across networks but it will have to be set up in a server first. Thanks for the interest!</p>
